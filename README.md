# CD_Project
## Project Structure  
**data** - consists of datasets to be analyzed  
**images** - store all the graphs produced for each data processing techniques applied over the dataset

Observations

decision_tree - dataset1  
Best results achieved with entropy criteria, depth=5 and min_impurity_decrease=0.00 ==> accuracy=0.57  

decision_tree - dataset2  
Best results achieved with entropy criteria, depth=25 and min_impurity_decrease=0.00 ==> accuracy=0.89
